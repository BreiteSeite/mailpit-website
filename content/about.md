<p class="lead">Mailpit was developed to provide a performant, modern, open source utility to test emails and SMTP delivery.</p>

Whilst other similar solutions already existed, they either lacked features, lacked support (eg: no longer maintained), did not perform well under load, or could not handle a significant number of emails (10k+).

The project was originally **inspired** by MailHog, which makes it a somewhat compatible (SMTP & HTTPS ports) as a drop-in replacement, however that is about where the similarities end.
Mailpit now contains an [extensive set](../docs/) of unique web UI & API features to assist email testing, packed into [a single binary](../docs/install/) with no system dependencies.


Mailpit was first released on Jul 30 2022, and despite being one of the newest players on the block, it did not take long for it to gain traction. 
Mailpit is fast becoming the go-to solution for SMTP capture & email testing, and is already integrated in several popular web development frameworks.
It is also playing a **massive role** in CI/CD infrastructures (see daily count in Docker statistics).
